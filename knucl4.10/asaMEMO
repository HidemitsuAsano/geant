1. actual setup for the simulation is located under

/gpfs/home/had/hiasano/ana/geant/knucl4.10/build


2. card setup

Knucl:PhysicsList               
<- should use "QGSP_BERT_HP" for good neutron calculation


Knucl:ProcessID 
<-  choose "K3He" even if it is for E31 simulation 


Knucl:FermiMotion 
diff. btw. on/off -> not checked yet


Knucl:FermiMotionMode      
offshell mothod: diff. btw. on/off -> not checked yet

Knucl:TwoStep off
not checked yet, not understood at all.
